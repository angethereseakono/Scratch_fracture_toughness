# Scratch_fracture_toughness
Method to calculate the fracture toughness using scratch testing
# Prerequisites
The method follows the theoretical model proposed in this paper: Akono, A.T., Randall, N.X. and Ulm, F.J., 2012. Experimental determination of the fracture toughness via microscratch tests: Application to polymers, ceramics, and metals. Journal of Materials Research, 27(2), pp.485-493.
